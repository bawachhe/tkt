A personal ticketing system with principles adapted from JIRA

I made this because I have a lot of personal project ideas floating around in my head and needed a tracking system; I saw JIRA and thought that would be good, but also a bit too robust for my relatively simple purposes, so I made one from scratch.

Please feel free to fork it, send me PRs if you think you have a nice improvement, etc.
